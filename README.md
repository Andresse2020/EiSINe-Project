# Raspberry Pi License Plate Recognition

This project is a **real-time license plate recognition system** running on a Raspberry Pi using a connected camera. It detects vehicles and reads their license plates, making it ideal for parking management, security, or automation projects.

## Features

- Real-time license plate detection using a camera.
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for reading plate numbers.
- Display results on screen or save to a file/database.
- Optimized for Raspberry Pi with limited resources.

## Tech Stack

- Raspberry Pi (3/4 recommended)
- Python 3
- OpenCV for image processing
- Tesseract OCR for license plate recognition
